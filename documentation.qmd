# Obstacles and Solutions:

### Ensuring Correct Upstream
#### Problem
I encountered the issue that I made mistakenly set the parent repository as my upstream. This made me encounter a 403b access error every time I proposed a push.

#### Solution

In terminal, I was able to solve this using:

``` {terminal}
% git remote add origin https://github.com/statds/ids-f24.git
```

### Opening book for html
#### Problem
When you use the following,
``` {terminal}
% quarto render
```

it may not be immediately obvious how to open the course page. This can be solved easily.

#### Solution
Open the book using:

``` {terminal}
% open _book/index.html
```
